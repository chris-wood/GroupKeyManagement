% Fixed input into the time function
N = [5,10,15,20,25,30]
P = [0.25,0.5,0.75,0.85,0.95,0.99,1.0]

% Resulting time computations
T = zeros(size(N)(2), size(P)(2));

% Compute all time combinations and then display the result
for i = 1:size(N)(2)
	for j = 1:size(P)(2)
		%val = time(0, 0, N(i), P(j));
		T(i,j) = time(0, 0, N(i), P(j));
	end
end

% Display the result
